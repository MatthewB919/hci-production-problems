## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=12P0u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: I chose this color palette because green represents new beginnings as well as green being one of the major console's brand color that being Xbox.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=50z0v0k-TvaltD-roA4CloLHwjj
Your Rationale: I chose these colors because as well as being adjacent colors these colors are associated with the colors of common flower colors.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=31T0S0kMZEEohM1voMkNvrTO-lD
Your Rationale: I went with this color palette because kids can easily identify that the letters are different from each other in bright bold letters. I also chose Red, Blue, and Yellow as when I was young in school learning about colors the most emphasized colors were red, yellow, and blue.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=1020S0k0HsPkw00++DJ++ymkh0c
Your Rationale: With this my reasoning was very simple, I thought that black and white are necessary for simple bold neutral colors towards the nature of cybersecurity and red to get people energized to want to take the course.
